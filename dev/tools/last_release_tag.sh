# Prints the last splash-claude release tag reachable from a commit.
#
# Plain `git describe --tags` is NOT safe in this fork. Upstream tags releases
# x.y.z, the same bare form we use, so `git fetch upstream` (without --no-tags)
# fills our tag namespace with upstream's releases, and after an upstream merge
# they are reachable via the merge's second parent. Anything built on that, the
# release notes' base or the next version, would silently point at upstream's
# release instead of ours.
#
# This resolver lists the tags reachable from <rev>, newest first, and refuses
# any that is not a fork release: a fork release is a tag whose
# dev/tools/package.py names this fork's repository, which upstream's never do.
#
# Usage:
#   bash dev/tools/last_release_tag.sh [<rev>]    # newest fork tag on <rev>'s first-parent line (default HEAD)
#
# Exit codes: 0 = tag printed, 2 = no valid fork tag found (the first fork release has not happened yet).
